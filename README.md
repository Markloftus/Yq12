Code written for the Y chromosome Yq12 region analyses

## NEW NOTE: Information on Yq12 Inversion Breakpoints #####
I am adding a folder here titled: Yq12_Inversion_Breakpoints. I noticed in the Supplemental Table 35 that I accidentally gave the old contig names for three samples (HG01890, HG00358, HG01952). So, 
within the new folder (Yq12_Inversion_Breakpoints) you will find 6 multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Each MSA has the sequence spanning from the 1st (Proximal or Distal _1st_Breakpoint) to 2nd breakpoint (Proximal or Distal _2nd_Breakpoint) for both the updated assembly (with the 'new' contig names) and the sequence from the 
'older' assembly (with the 'old' contig names). You can see for yourself that the sequences are exactly the same and occur at the same coordinates. The only difference is the contig name. Sorry for inconvenience this may cause you but 
I wanted to make sure this information was available. Within that folder you will also find a file titled Yq_Contigs.txt this text file shows information on Sample, Contig name (Old and new), and coordinates for the three samples mentioned above. Just to reiterate, it is all the same sequences (as shown by the MSAs) just the final assemblies utilize a different contig naming convention.
